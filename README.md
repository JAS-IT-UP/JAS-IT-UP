### Summary

Overconsumption and overproduction, characterized by excessive production and consumption of goods, contribute significantly to environmental degradation and resource depletion. Many realtors contribute to the saturation of waste in landfills, “The fashion industry is responsible for producing nearly 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions.”(Upcycling, Sustainability, and IP: what it means for the world of fashion). Currently, “Statistics show that 21% of Americans upcycle clothing, boxes, and goods regularly - reducing the need for production of new goods.”(#27 Upcycling. HEAL THE PLANET), hence why embracing practices such as upcycling, recycling, and reusing presents a viable solution to mitigate the impact of overconsumption. Upcycling is an innovative way to reduce your carbon footprint as well as keep things fun with added benefits as it  “...minimizes the need for new raw or synthetically-created materials. These materials are no longer necessary and increasing their life cycle, upcycling reduces landfill waste.”(Calboli). By upcycling, we transform discarded materials into new, valuable products, reducing the need for raw resources and minimizing waste. Recycling allows us to process used materials into new products, conserving energy and diminishing the environmental footprint associated with manufacturing. Additionally, reusing items promotes a culture of sustainability by extending the lifecycle of products and reducing the demand for constant production. Emphasizing these practices helps manage waste and encourages a shift towards a more circular and responsible consumption model, fostering environmental stewardship and a healthier planet for future generations.

### The Problem 

It is common to fixate on recycling as the primary solution. However, our control over waste extends beyond the recycling bin. The real challenge lies in our consumption habits. Impulsive purchases and overconsumption contribute significantly to waste production.
___



### Our Solution

If we acknowledge the pressing issue of overconsumption and its adverse environmental effects, our solution transcends the conventional focus on recycling by introducing a comprehensive approach encompassing upcycling, recycling, and reusing. 

By recognizing that the root of the problem lies in waste disposal and our consumption habits, we have developed a user-friendly platform that encourages and guides individuals in creative upcycling endeavors. This, in turn, empowers them to transform discarded materials into valuable items. The emphasis on reusing plays a pivotal role in extending the lifecycle of products and fostering a culture of responsible consumption. As a result, this comprehensive approach reduces the demand for new raw resources and minimizes waste production. Simultaneously, it promotes efficient recycling, energy conservation, and lessening the environmental impact associated with manufacturing. If we collectively engage in these efforts, we can address the challenge of overconsumption and inspire a shift towards more sustainable living.
